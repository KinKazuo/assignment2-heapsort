Peer Code Review: Analysis of Test Suite
Algorithm: Shell Sort (Yevgeniy Averyanov)

Section: Code Review – Testing Quality

✅ Strengths of the Test Implementation
1. Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage
The test suite includes essential edge cases:

Empty array (testEmptyArray)
Single element (testSingleElement)
Already sorted arrays
Reverse-sorted arrays
Nearly-sorted arrays
Large random input
This satisfies the requirement in Section 6: Testing Requirements, which mandates testing across edge cases and various input distributions.

2. Validation Across All Gap Sequences
Each test runs the algorithm with three gap sequences:
Shellsort.sort(actual, "shell");
Shellsort.sort(actual, "knuth");
Shellsort.sort(actual, "sedgewick");
This ensures that all variants are verified, not just one sequence. 
It demonstrates awareness that different gaps may affect behavior — especially important since performance varies significantly between them.
3. Use of Randomized Input at Scale
The testRandomArray method generates a large dataset (10,000 elements) with randomized values:
actual[i] = rand.nextInt(10000) - 5000;
It then compares results against Java’s built-in Arrays.sort():
assertArrayEquals(sorted, actual);
This is an excellent example of cross-validation, as recommended in Section 6: Cross-Validation.
4. Clear Structure and Readability
Tests follow clean naming conventions:

testEmptyArray
testSortedArray
testReversedSortedArray
Each has a single responsibility and uses descriptive assertions. No duplicated logic.
Areas for Improvement
1. Missing Duplicates and Special Value Tests
While many cases are covered, there is no explicit test for:

Arrays with duplicate values
Arrays containing only identical elements
Inputs with extreme values (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE)
These can expose issues in comparison logic or boundary handling.
@Test
public void testAllDuplicates() {
    int[] actual = {5, 5, 5, 5};
    Shellsort.sort(actual, "shell");
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5, 5, 5, 5}, actual);
}
2. No Verification of Performance Metrics
The tests check correctness, but do not validate performance characteristics such as:

Number of comparisons
Swaps
Time complexity trends
Since metrics collection is part of the assignment (Section 2: Metrics collection), it would strengthen the test suite to include basic checks like:
assertTrue(metrics.getComparisons() <= 10_000);
3. Hardcoded Array Sizes
The large random test uses a fixed size (10000). While valid, scalability should be tested across sizes (e.g., 100, 1000, 10000).
 Suggestion: Parameterize the test using loops or JUnit parameterized tests:
for (int n : new int[]{100, 1000, 10000}) {
}
4. Reliance on JUnit 4 (org.junit.Test)
Uses older JUnit 4 (import org.junit.Test;) instead of JUnit 5.
While functional, adopting modern testing frameworks improves extensibility (e.g., @ParameterizedTest, better assertions).
Suggestion: Upgrade to JUnit 5 for future projects.
